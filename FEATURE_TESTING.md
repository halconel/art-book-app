## Test Infrastructure

### Testing Stack
- **RSpec** - Test framework
- **Capybara** - Browser automation
- **Selenium WebDriver** - Chrome headless driver
- **FactoryBot** - Test data generation
- **Database Cleaner** - Test isolation

### Helper Modules

#### Authentication Helpers (`spec/features/shared/authentication_helpers.rb`)
```ruby
sign_in_as_admin(admin = nil)    # Admin login
sign_in_as_client(client = nil)  # Client login  
expect_admin_dashboard           # Verify admin access
expect_client_dashboard          # Verify client access
```

#### UI Helpers (`spec/features/shared/ui_helpers.rb`)
```ruby
wait_for_react_to_load          # Wait for React components
fill_in_react_field(label, value) # Material-UI form fields
expect_success_notification     # Success toast messages
within_modal(&block)            # Modal dialog interactions
upload_test_image(field, file)  # File upload testing
```

### Test Data Factories

All factories support traits for different states:

```ruby
create(:admin_user)                    # Admin user
create(:client_user, :unverified)     # Unverified client
create(:creative_pack, :with_cycles)  # Pack with cycles
create(:future_art, :commission)      # Commission order
create(:notification, :order_created) # Order notification
```

## Running Tests

### Quick Start
```bash
# Run all feature tests
./claude/commands/run-feature-tests.sh

# Run specific scenario
bundle exec rspec spec/features/admin/daily_cycle_workflow_spec.rb

# Run with debugging (visible browser)
DEBUG=true bundle exec rspec spec/features/admin/
```

### Test Environment Setup
```bash
# Prepare test database
bundle exec rails db:test:prepare

# Precompile assets (if needed)
bundle exec rails assets:precompile RAILS_ENV=test

# Install Chrome for Testing (if not available)
# Tests will fall back to system Chrome
```

### CI/CD Integration
```bash
# Headless mode for CI
bundle exec rspec spec/features/ --tag ~debug

# Generate coverage report
COVERAGE=true bundle exec rspec spec/features/

# JUnit format for CI systems
bundle exec rspec spec/features/ --format RspecJunitFormatter --out results.xml
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Chrome/ChromeDriver Issues:**
```bash
# Update Chrome and ChromeDriver
# Tests will provide specific error messages

# For debugging, run with visible browser:
DEBUG=true bundle exec rspec spec/features/admin/daily_cycle_workflow_spec.rb
```

**Database Issues:**
```bash
# Reset test database
bundle exec rails db:test:drop db:test:create db:test:prepare

# Clear test cache
bundle exec rails test:cache:clear
```

**Asset Compilation Issues:**  
```bash
# Recompile test assets
bundle exec rails assets:precompile RAILS_ENV=test

# Clear asset cache
bundle exec rails assets:clean
```

### Debug Mode
Set `DEBUG=true` to run tests with visible browser for debugging:
```bash
DEBUG=true bundle exec rspec spec/features/admin/daily_cycle_workflow_spec.rb
```

## Maintenance

### Adding New Scenarios
1. Create new spec file in appropriate directory
2. Use existing factories and helpers
3. Follow naming convention: `*_spec.rb`
4. Add to test runner script
5. Update this documentation

### Updating Test Data
- Modify factories in `spec/factories/`
- Update helper methods as needed
- Ensure backward compatibility
- Test data should reflect realistic usage

### Performance Monitoring
- Monitor test execution times
- Identify slow scenarios for optimization
- Consider parallel execution for large suites
- Profile database queries in slow tests

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Before Committing
```bash
# Run related feature tests
bundle exec rspec spec/features/admin/ --fail-fast

# Run full suite before major changes
./claude/commands/run-feature-tests.sh
```

### Before Deployment
```bash
# Full feature test validation
./claude/commands/run-feature-tests.sh

# Verify in production-like environment
RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rspec spec/features/ --tag production_ready
```

This comprehensive feature testing implementation ensures that all critical user workflows are thoroughly validated before production deployment.
